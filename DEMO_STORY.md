- ✅ **Source Citations**: Every answer backed by specific document references
- ✅ **Interactive Evidence**: Click any citation chip to see source

**What to Say**:
> *"Notice how AI CORE doesn't just give you an answer - it gives you the COMPLETE engineering context. Key values extracted, critical steps highlighted, and most importantly - every piece of information is cited back to specific pages in the source manuals. This is evidence-based engineering."*

#### **Optional Deep Dive**
- Click **"Compare Library + Upload"** scope
- Show the **conflict detection** when supplier manual disagrees
- Highlight the **severity ratings** and **recommendations**

**What to Say**:
> *"Now watch what happens when I upload a supplier manual that has a different procedure. AI CORE automatically detects the conflicts, rates their severity, and gives clear recommendations. No more ambiguity - you know exactly which specification to follow."*

### **2. COMPARE - Version Analysis (2 minutes)**

#### **The Setup**
*"Now we know there was a change. But what exactly changed between 2021 and 2022? Let's compare the full service manuals."*

#### **Demo Actions**
1. **Navigate to Compare page**
2. **Select Documents**:
   - Document A: *Defender 2021 Powertrain Service Manual*
   - Document B: *Defender 2022 Powertrain Service Manual*
3. **Click "Compare Documents"**

#### **Key Highlights**
- ✅ **Document Metadata**: Version, pages, year clearly displayed
- ✅ **Stats Dashboard**: 25 changes, 5 added, 18 modified, 2 removed, 76% similarity
- ✅ **Interactive Filters**: Filter by Added/Modified/Removed
- ✅ **Search Functionality**: Type "cylinder" to find related changes
- ✅ **3 View Modes**: Split (default), Unified (git-style), Timeline (chronological)

#### **Demo Actions - Show Changes**
1. **Click first change** (Cylinder Head Bolt Torque) - **Shows it expanded**
2. **Point out the side-by-side comparison**:
   - Left (RED): Before - 15 Nm → 65 Nm + 180°
   - Right (GREEN): After - 20 Nm → 70 Nm + 180°

**What to Say**:
> *"Here's the smoking gun. Stage 1 torque increased from 15 to 20 Newton-meters. Stage 2 increased from 65 to 70. This is a 33% increase in initial torque - that's significant. And look - you can see exactly which document version, which page, and which section this came from."*

3. **Scroll to show "TTY Bolt Replacement Requirement" (ADDED)**
4. **Point out it's marked as "ADDED" with green badge**

**What to Say**:
> *"And here's the critical one - this entire requirement is NEW in 2022. The 2021 manual didn't explicitly state that these are torque-to-yield bolts that must be replaced. That's why we were seeing failures - technicians were reusing bolts."*

5. **Demo the view modes**:
   - Click **Unified View** - Show git-style diff
   - Click **Timeline View** - Show chronological visualization

**What to Say**:
> *"You can view these changes in different ways depending on your workflow. Timeline view is great for understanding the progression of changes. Unified view is perfect for engineers familiar with version control."*

### **3. EXTRACT - Technical Data Mining (1-2 minutes)**

#### **The Setup**
*"Now that we understand what changed, we need to extract ALL torque specifications for the entire P300 engine assembly - not just cylinder head bolts."*

#### **Demo Actions**
1. **Navigate to Extract page**
2. **Point out the stats**: 24 records, 2 critical items
3. **Click "Critical Only" filter** - Shows only critical specs

#### **Key Highlights**
- ✅ **Table View**: Organized, sortable data
- ✅ **Critical Highlighting**: Red-bordered rows for critical items
- ✅ **Pulsing Indicators**: Animated red dots on critical items
- ✅ **Citations**: Every specification links to source
- ✅ **Export Ready**: Can export to CSV/Excel

**What to Say**:
> *"This is where AI CORE becomes a productivity multiplier. Instead of manually flipping through 456 pages of documentation, AI CORE extracted all 24 torque specifications, tagged the critical ones, and maintained source traceability for every single value. This table is ready to export to your engineering checklist."*

4. **Switch to JSON View** - Show structured data
5. **Switch to Checklist View** - Show verification workflow

**What to Say** (Checklist View):
> *"The checklist view is perfect for assembly verification. As technicians complete each torque operation, they can check it off. The progress bar shows completion status, and critical items are clearly highlighted. This reduces human error during assembly."*

---

### **4. LIBRARY - Source Transparency (1 minute)**

#### **The Setup**
*"Finally, let's see where all this information is coming from. Source transparency is critical for safety-critical systems."*

## 💡 **Key Demo Talking Points**

### **1. Evidence-Based, Not Magic**
> *"This isn't a chatbot making things up. Every answer is grounded in your actual engineering documentation, with specific page and section citations. If the AI can't find evidence, it won't guess."*

### **2. Conflict Detection**
> *"When you're working with multiple sources - OEM specs, supplier manuals, field reports - conflicts are inevitable. AI CORE automatically detects these conflicts, rates their severity, and gives engineering-backed recommendations."*

### **3. Version Control for Technical Docs**
> *"Engineering documentation evolves. AI CORE treats your technical documents like code - with full version comparison, change tracking, and delta analysis. You can see exactly what changed, when, and why."*

### **4. Workflow Integration**
> *"Notice how the flow works - Ask a question, Compare documents, Extract data, Verify sources. This mirrors how engineers actually work. It's not about replacing engineers - it's about eliminating the tedious parts so they can focus on analysis and decision-making."*

### **5. Production-Ready**
> *"This isn't a research project. The extracted torque specifications table? Export it to your manufacturing checklist. The comparison report? Send it to the change review board. The citations? Link them in your engineering change notice. It's designed for real engineering workflows."*
